        <p>Looking into the picture, how do you feel? Do you feel to be there, alone for sometime. Exploring the magnificence and majestic nature. Calm but it blows you and inspires you to seek for a higher calling. It drives you to search for the reason behind all of these events in your life.</p>
        <span class="quote">"ALWAYS REMEMBER, IT IS ALL CONNECTED. YOUR PAST, PRESENT & FUTURE ALL ARE CONNECTED TO A STORY, THAT IS ONLY UNIQUE TO YOU. THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE COME FOR."</span>
        <p>Do you know that Bees only go for the best of flowers. Not the immatured one or the spoiled ones. Even one bee can know by smelling if that particular flower is touched by another bee. If it is, then it won't touch the flower. Why? so that they can give us only the best and fresh honey. So, the moral of the story is : NEVER SETTLE. KEEP LOOKING FOR THE BEST.</p>
